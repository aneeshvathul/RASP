# RASP: A collaborative Renal AI Segmentation Pipeline

1) Collaboration
* Added a pull feature to the QuPath-OMERO Extension
* Pathologists can export their annotations to OMERO and retrieve them without ever leaving QuPath!

2) Customization
* Created a fully functional Python runtime environment inside QuPath
* Pathologists can run their own robust machine learning and data analysis scripts inside of QuPath

3) Pre-Set Automation
* Includes a pretrained renal tissue segmentation model, fully integrated with QuPath via the Paquo library
